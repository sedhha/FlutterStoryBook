# FlutterStoryBook
A simplified storybook app which helps you navigate through various conditions until you reach the end.
Your uncle friend has attacked you, He used to be a good person who was forced to be a bad guy due to circumstances he faced in 
his life.

Here is your chance to make him realize his mistake and prevent him from killing you. Follow your gut instincts and reach till the
end of the story, either you die or he gets caught or you convince him to give up all this and be a good person. In case you die,
you get 0 points, in case you get him caught to cops, you get 5 points and finally in case you're able to convince him to be a nice
person you get 10 points.

All the very best!
